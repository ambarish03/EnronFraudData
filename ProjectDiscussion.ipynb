The \"TOTAL\" line was rolled into the dataset as a separate entity in addition to all the other records in the dataset. The other bad record involved an entity \"THE TRAVEL AGENCY IN THE PARK\" which could have been a business entity providing travel/concierge services for Enron employees and hence should have excluded from the dataset. In addition to these two records, I noticed that all the features corresponding to \"LOCKHART EUGENE E\" contained NaN and hence did not provide any useful information in the context of this study. Therefore, I truncated these three records from the overall dataset. In addition to these aforementioned outliers/bad data, I noticed that the person-level data for \"BELFER ROBERT\" and \"BHATNAGAR SANJAY\" were slightly off from what was provided in the pdf document included in the project folder.
